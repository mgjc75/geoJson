# ARUP Technical Test - GEO JSON

## Brief

In this exercise you will develop a web application that uses the JSON data consisting of various points and polygons provided and show it on a map. This will be purely a proof of concept and you are not expected to develop an entire application.

Functionality can then be added to add, update, and search the various points and polygons.

## Wireframe

<table border="2">
<tr>
    <td width="300px" height="300px" align="center">MAP</td>
    <td width="50px">CONTROLS</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Tools, Libraries and Frameworks

For this task, you are free to use whatever technology stack/frameworks you wish but you are advised to keep things simple and concise. Hint, a standard, vanilla javscript approach id best :o)

### Recommendation

LeafletJS - https://leafletjs.com/index.html - The tutorial and docs are very, very helpful.

## Assessment

We will assess based on the following criteria:
- Understanding of problem
- Proposed design/architecture of solution
- Tools and methodologies used
- Quality of code
