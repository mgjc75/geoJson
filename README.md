# ARUP Technical Test - GEO JSON

## Brief

In this exercise you will develop a web application that uses the JSON data consisting of various points and polygons provided and show it on a map. This will be purely a proof of concept and you are not expected to develop an entire application.

Functionality can then be added to add, update, and search the various points and polygons.

## Wireframe

<table border="2">
<tr>
    <td width="300px" height="300px" align="center">MAP</td>
    <td width="50px">CONTROLS</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Tools, Libraries and Frameworks

For this task, you are free to use whatever technology stack/frameworks you wish but you are advised to keep things simple and concise.

### Recommendation

LeafletJS - https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.0.html

Try to stick to HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript / JQuery.
